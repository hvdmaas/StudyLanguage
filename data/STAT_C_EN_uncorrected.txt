Answer: 1) the section of the basic report that is involved is the part ‘causal explanations’ and then especially the part in which has to be thought about alternative explanations.
2) Students think of a plausible explanation, in the form of a good story. What the heuristic changes is that students after that stop thinking.
3) The aspect of how plausible the alternative explanations are.

Answer:
Causal Explanation: Because the study was passively observed, there are several explanations for the results. The primary explanation is that the training improved the ‘Integration Motivation’. An alternative explanation is that participating in this study itself led to a feeling of ‘belonging to a group’; which then influenced the training and the ‘Integration Motivation’ seperately.

Answer: 1) The hypotheses may be involved, as the student might not think about all possible directions. Also the causal interpretations are involved, because people often tend to stop searching for more plausible explanations after they have found one which seems to be good.
2) when you think abstractly, you seem to be able quite well to think beyond only “one good story”, but in concrete terms this ability seems to drop, as we tend to think more association-sensitive then
3) The answers will be less good concerning the “causal interpretations” when it comes to the part where students have to find alternative explanations. As they tend to find one, which seems to be good and then they stop searching for further plausible explanations.

Answer:
Causal Explanation: This was no experiment, therefore there is more than only one explanation possible. The primary explanation is that the training (before or after training) does not influence the motivation towards integration. Another plausible alternative hypothesis could be that the time of measurement could have influenced the indication of motivation of the participants. For example, after filling out the questionnaire as a pre-measurement, and after conducting the training, they might have experienced some fatique effect and therefore were influenced by filling out the post-measurement questionnaire. Also, if too much time passed between the measurements and the training, this might have an influence.

Causal Explanation: This was not a real experiment. There was no counterbalancing / control group. The primary explanation would be that following the training programme would lead to the higher mean in the ‘Integration Motivation’ in the post measurement. However, as this was not a real experiment, there are several alternative explanations and you can’t conclude causality. One alternative explanation would be, that due to the amount of time that the training programme takes, the before / and after measurements take place at diferent point of times and it could be that the participants integrated more in that time / got more motivation to integrate due to more time already spent in the Netherlands (-->therefore feel more comfortable for example).

The primary explanation is that the independent variable “time” influences the dependent variable “IM score”, with the time after the programme increasing the IM score on average. A possible alternative explanation could be the influence of the that has passed in between the conditions. In that respect, perhaps the increased motivation towards integrating into the Dutch society has not increased due to the programme, but simply because the participants have spent more time living in the Netherlands, which might have made them more willing to integrate because they like it there and got to know the culture better.

Causal Explanation: There is more than one explanation, because it is no true experiment. Primary explanation is that the motivational training has an influence on the ‘Integration Motivation’. An alternative explanation would be that time has passed between pre-and post-measurement, which is why the participants felt more motivated for integration.

Answer:
Causal Explanation: This is not an experiment. So several explanations are possible. The primary explanation is that the training programme influences ‘Integration Motivation’ so that IM will be bigger after training. An alternative explanation is the family situation of the participants. A bad situation in the family, due to not finding an active role in Dutch society could influence their score in the motivation scale.

Answer: 1) The good story heuristic is important for the causal interpretation part of the basic report, where an alternative explanation might be necessary. 
2) The good story heuristic implies that people tend to stop their thought process after thinking one good explanation for something, instead of searching for a better explanation.
3) Because they stop thinking after the first explanation the answer might be less good as they could possibly find a even better explanation.

Answer: 1) The Good Story Heuristic describes the fact that students find plausible explanations for relevant facts for passive observations in form of a good story when there are alternative explanations. They are easily satisfied and stop thinking about better explanations. When they make a Basic Report finding alternative explanations is part of the causal interpretations of a t-test. There are always alternative explanations when the study is not experimental.
2) Student should always continue to think about better alternative explanations so being critical with themselves.
3) For example reversed causality doesn’t fit in every content of a study (e.g. gender--> income but not income-->gender).

Causal Explanation: As the study was not an experiment, there are several explanations possible. The primary explanation is that the training programme increased the mean IM. An alternative explanation could be that the later point in time is responsible for the participants’ increase in motivation to integrate because they like to socialize more at later times of the day.

Causal Explanation: Even though this is a real experiment with randomisation and manipulation one may not conclude causality between the programme and a higher integration motivation from it. This is due to possible confounding variables that may be the real reason for this change. One example for a confounding variable in this example is social desireability, which means that many of the participants felt like they were expected to answer more positivly in the second questionaire. Another possible confounding variable is reciprocity, which means the individual’s feeling of resposibility to give something back after recieving something, in this case more positive answers after the programme.

Causal Explanation: Because this is a non-experimental degree of control, there are several explanations. The primary explanation is that the training programme does not increase the motivation towards integrating into dutch society in an active way. An alternative explanation is the cultural background of the ethnic minority group, or rather the culture that was built due to being a minority. The minority group might dislike the dutch culture and avoid confrontation or integration, because living in a minority group has leas to an ingroup (minority)-outroup (dutch citizens) formation. This means, people from the minority population in this research are generally against integration, and therefore somewhat immune towards a trainingprogram of the opposite purpose.

3) This may influence the fact that students only look at the possible part of the hypothesis, so only if it fits as a story.

Causal Explanation: A it is non-experimental, there are several explanations. The primary explanation is that the programme influences the integration motivation. An alternative explanation would be that simply the contact with the dutch psychologist increases the IM. Maybe, they did not have contact to Dutch people before. So, it’s not the programme but rather meeting Dutch people.

2) If there is no name for the variables (just x and y) the average student will use the abstract rules for alternative explanations and will consider all three possibilities. However, if there are names given to the variables he will forget about the rule, treats his first alternative explanation as a fact and stop thinking.

Answer: 
Causal Explanation: This was not an experiment. So, several explanations are possible. The primary explanation is that training programme influences ‘integration motivation’. An alternative explanation is, that the second questionnaire results are the result of a training-effect. That means that the participants understood what the questionnaire intended to measure because they have to fill it in a second time and therefore are more experienced with this questionnaire. As a result the answers on the second questionnaire are more social desirable and therefore higher.

Causal Explanation: The primary explanation is that the independent variable time influences the dependent variable IM. Since this study was non-experimental there can also be other explanations. One alternative explanation can be a fatique effect, which describes the phenomenon that participants get tired due to the duration of the procedure which influences their performance. A second alternative explanation could be a training effect, because the participants already did the IM questionnaire once which can lead to an improvement in the second measurement which is not caused by the programme itself.
