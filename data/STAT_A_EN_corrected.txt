Antwoord: In one study discussed in the book psychology students received material about the different studies of an university. The material contained a lot of statistics and three personal reports from students. Afterwards the psychology students had to decide which study programme they liked best and most decided for the programme that was described in the personal report instead of the more valid statistical data that prefered other studies. This is an example for being insensitive to sample size.

Antwoord: A good example for a study that shows that people are sometimes insensitive to sample size, is a study where new students were divided into two groups (condition 1, condition 2) and had to choose a course at university after they had been exposed to the condition they were in. Condition A entailed, reading mean course evaluations of a dozen of students, and condition B entailed having a personal interview with a few students about the courses. \n Even though the sample in condition A was much larger (thus more reliable than a few recommendations of students) the results showed, that the students were more affected by the vivid descriptions of a few students than by the results of a mean course evaluation that was based on a much larger sample. Thus, these students were insensitive to sample size, because they did not take into account that a larger sample is more reliable.

Antwoord: The study in which people were interviewed to see what their estimates are about to what extend other people agree with them. The result was that people largely overestimate to what extend other people agree with them. It was presented in the book as insensitivity to sample bias. People do not consider the fact that they are largely surrounded by people who have the same views as them. I also think this is an example of insensitivity to sample size because they did not consider that their direct environment is much smaller than the whole population.

Antwoord: In a study participants have been asked how likely it is that in a hospital 60% of the babies born per day are male. Participants had to choose between a smaller and a larger hospital, and they could also say that the chances are equal in both hospitals. The majority of the participants answered that it is equally likely that 60% of the babies born per day are male in a small and a large hospital, even though there is a much lower number of babies born per day in a small hospital compared to the large hospital. Participants who studies statistics before, did not do this mistake because they were aware of the Law of Large Numbers.

Antwoord: In a research study subjects who did not study statistics were described two hospitals. One large hospital has 45 born children each day and one small hospital has 15 births of children per day. Then they were asked which one of the two hospitals is more likely to have 60% or more boys births per day. \n Most of the subjects said that both hospitals have an equal probability. The other subjects indicated equal amount of hospital one or two. \n They ignored the Law of large Numbers, which says that a sample mean approaches the population mean, if it is large enough.

Antwoord: In the study participants were invited to view an interview with a prison guard. To half of the participants the prison guard acted really humane and wanted to rehabilitate the prisoners. The other half of the participants were shown a prison guard that acted really inhumane and said he wanted to teach the prisoners a lesson. After that both groups of participants had to rate the geral_nonexisting prison guard. Even when information was provided to the participants that the guard was described to be extremely humane or inhumane (within the lower or upper 4%). The study clearly showed that participants based their estimation much more on the vivid experience, than on abstract numbers.

Antwoord: Participants in that study were Psychology students who had to choose a course. In the first trial, they could see the mean course evaluation from 20-130 students. In the second part, ? students orally presented their evaluation of the course. The independent variable was the form of presentation (statistically / vividly) and the dependent variable the choice of the course. The study reveals that participants were more influenced by the orally presented evaluations than by the mean course evaluation, even though the sample size of the 2nd one is much bigger and thus, more representative. But, the participants were insensitive to sample size and put more emphasis on vivid information.

Antwoord: One study concerning “sample size” was conducted by Kahneman and Tversky. They told the participants about two hospitals, a big (45 babies a day) and a small one (15 babies a day. They asked the participants to indicate in which hospital it was more likely that at one time 60% boys were born. Most participants rated the likelihood of the hospitals having 60% boys the same. They were insensitive to that small samples have higher variation, and therefore have the greater likelihood for 60% boys.

The second one was a description of the different courses which was made by three or four students. Most of the people were more influenced by the description by the three / four students. The study shows us that many people are insensitive to sample size because they were more influenced by the small sample (3/4 students) than by the statistical information where the sample was bigger. ?

Antwoord: A study that highlights the insensitivity to sample size was conducted in an university in which students had to choose between certain courses they want to participate in. One group of students received a course evaluation that was completed by 26 out of 127 students. The other group received an oral presentation of three students that took part in the courses. \n\n Results indicated that the written course evaluation had less influenced the participants than the presentations. This is an example of insensitivity to sample size because although, the written evaluation had a much larger sample than the oral presentations and is therefore more reliable, participants were more influenced and put more weight on the three presentations.

Antwoord: Insensitivity to sample bias; people were asked in which case it is more likely that 60% boys are born on a day. In a small hospital with 15 birth per day or in a big hospital with 45 birth a day. Most people said it does not matter. \n They thought the chance is equal, and that the size of the hospital does not matter, this can be explained by the fact that the asked people had no knowledge of statistics, they ignored relevant information.  In fact, it is way more likely for the small hospital to have 60% birthrate of boys. The bigger the sample size is, the more likely we can expect a result which comes close to the reality in this study; 50%.

The population was asked in which it is more likely that 60% boys are born. Most used the small one, because it is more likely that there could be a day in which one boy was born or and so rising the percentage. But in smaller of fact it is the large hospital, because though the larger sample it is more likely that it equalizes with the population mean.

Antwoord: The study was conducted with psychology students. The student had to evaluate which course they would like to take. For this, the researchers gave them statistical summaries of different courses first. In addition, they also got written personal recommendations from other students. \n As result the students preferred the courses for which they read the recommendations rather than those for which they got statistical summaries. \n This shows that the participants let influence themselves by the way the information was presented, even though the sample was way smaller of the personal recommendations than the sample and also the sample mean of the courses with the statistical summaries.

Antwoord: A study with 2 groups, one including people with statistical knowledge, the other one including people without statistical knowledge. Both groups were presented with 2 hospitals, one small one and one large one. In the small hospital approximately 15 babies were born every day and in the large hospital approximately 45 babies were born every day. \n Now both groups were asked to estimate in which hospital 60% of the babies were boys. \n The group without statistical knowledge said that in both hospitals the chances are equally high to have 60% of their babies being male. \n This error did not occur in the group with statistical knowledge. Here the people took the law of large numbers into account. Which says that the larger the sample size the more approaches the sample mean the population mean. \n In this case the population mean would be that 50% of the babies are male and 50% are female. Since the smaller hospital automatically has a smaller sample size it is more likely to have a sample mean not close to the population mean. In this case 60% male babies instead of 50% male babies.

The participants were asked if the chance is bigger that 60% of newborn babies are boys in a big hospital with 45 births a day or in a small hospital with 15 births a day. 95% of the participants said that it’s equal. Under the other 5% each hospital was chosen equally. Fact is that the chance in the smaller hospital is larger because the sample size in the bigger hospital is bigger so the chances that there are born the same amount of boys and girls is higher.

In this study participants were asked to estimate in which of the two hospital (big or small) the probability of 60% boys being born in one of the 15 days assessed would be highest. It turned out that people tend to be insensitive to sample size by not taking into account the smaller size of one of the hospitals, where thus the probability of 60% boys being born would be higher since it is further away from the actual population.

Antwoord: A study done by Ross, Amabile and Steinmetz (1977) posed participants with a question of probability. Participants were asked to consider two hospitals: one in which 45 babies were born in a day, and one in which 15 babies were born a day. The participants were asked whether the chance that 60% of the babies was born a boy was bigger in the small or big hospital (or whether it was as likely to happen in either place). \n\n The results were that participants thought that the chances were the same. Of course, according to basic probability, the chance should be lower in the big hospital (according to the Law of Large numbers). As participants were quite wrong in this environment, it tells us that they were not sensitive to actively looking for the sample sizes.

In the larger hospital 45 babies are born on average. The question was in which hospital is the probability larger that 60% boys are born per day. The hospitals were chosen equally, from the students who never had a statistic course, because they were insensitivity to sample size. The deviation in the small hospital is larger and the probability of 60% boys higher.

Antwoord: An example of a study highlighting insensitivity to ‘sample size’  is the ‘vivid information study’. In this study, Psychology students were randomly assigned to two groups. One group was asked to read the subjective opinion of a few former students on a number of courses for the programme. These reports were written in a personal and vivid style. \n The other group of students was asked to look at the results of a great number of former students rating the same courses on a numbered scale. This information was presented neutrally and objectively, and the students were informed of the great sample size were based on the ratings. The two groups were then asked to indicate which course they would like to take. \n The results of the study show that the group which had to read the descriptions of only a few others was more affected by the information than the group exposed to ratings from a larger sample. \n\n This illustrates that people tend to put too much weight on the results from small samples, especially if worded interestingly and vividly, while putting too little weight on the results from large samples, especially if worded or presented neutrally.

Before and after getting this, they were asked their opinion about welfare (money from the state) and about what they think about these people. There was a noticeable change in attitude towards the people getting this money in the group that got a vivid story, even if the experimenters told them earlier that this case is not representative for this topic. \n This shows that vivid, interesting information can lead people to change their attitude, forgetting (or not considering) that it is just about one certain case and not representative and intuitively ignoring the Law of Large numbers. \n This did not happen in the group that got statistical information, which was representative and general about all cases instead of just one.

Antwoord: I cannot recall an exact study, but I will still describe an example of insensitivity to sample size. \n\n Consider two hospitals. In one hospital, 20 babies are born a week. In the other, 50 are born a week. Now question whether there is a larger chance, that the ratio of male to female babies being born is 6 to 4 (so 60% to 40$), is higher in the first or second hospital, or neither, as it is equal. \n\n Saying that they have equal chances is wrong, an effect from insensitivity to sample size. As N increases, the distribution of males / females will lean closer to 50:50. Therefore, a hospital with less babies being born a week has a higher chance to be off the 50% split.

Antwoord: There was an example about a study, which examined the perception of 2 studies (one represented in a magazine, the other presented as a scientific report) by a group of people. The study in the magazine had less participants but was more vividly presented than the study in the scientific report, which had a significantly larger sample size, but was boring to read. The result was that the people emphasized the results of the magazine-study much more than the study in the boring report, even though it had a smaller sample size.

Most participants said it’s about 50% in each hospital. But the smaller hospital has a higher chance of scoring different because of the smaller rates of birth. The bigger hospital in contrast has a bigger birth rate and has therefore a higher chance of being at 50%.

The other group received the comments 2 to 3 students gave for those courses. After reading the information, the participants had to choose which course of the 10 they would like to take. The results showed that the participants were more influenced by the small sample of vivid information than by the abstract means. Even though the means were driven from a much larger sample. \n The study therefore showed that often people take information of small samples more seriously than those from large samples. They are insensitive to sample size.

Antwoord: Kahneman and Tversky conducted a study in which they have participants the following task: The average number of daily born babies is 15 in one hospital and 46 in another hospital. In which hospital the situation that 60% of the babies are boys, will occur more frequently? \n Most participants answered that it is equally probable in both hospitals. The remaining ones equally either the smaller or the larger hospital. The remaining ones equally either the smaller or the larger hospital. The study shows that people are sometimes insensitive to sample size, as they do not realize that in small samples extreme outcomes occur more frequently than in larger samples. So, actually they should have chosen the smaller hospital. \n The study also found that, when trained in statistics, this error did no longer occur.

Antwoord: Participants get to know two hospitals. One is a large hospital and the other one is a small one. In the large one 45 babies are getting born per day, on average. In the small one 15 babies are getting born per day, on average. The participants were asked which probability that there are 60% boys or more is in the hospital larger. The participants said that this is equal. But the large hospital “gets” 45 babies a day and has so on a larger sample and a larger sample is closer to the population mean. So the answer should be that the probability that the hospital gets 60% boys or more is higher in the large hospital.

Antwoord: A study that highlights the insensitivity to sample size is the study about conversion disorders and the relation to sexual abuse. \n In one condition, the sample number of 26 people contains 4 people who were sexually abused. In this case that would be 4/26=15%. In the other condition, the sample number is small with 2 people, where 2 people were abused. The percentage of the abused people are much higher with 2/3=67%. \n Despite these big differences in outcomes, people think that the study with the small sample is equally credible as the larger sample and that the outcomes should just be somewhere in between. \n This shows that people tend to ignore the law of large numbers, meaning that the larger the sample, the higher the reliability of the study and the average of the sample gets closer to the mean. So in the study it would be best by adding the sample number together, so that the sample size gets larger.

Antwoord: In a study a scenario with two hospitals was presented to people. In hospital A there were 45 children born every day and in hospital B there were 15 children born every day. The participants of the study were then asked to estimate in which hospital it is more likely that on one day 60% of the newborn children are boys. Most of the participants guessed that the chances would be equal. But this is wrong. The participants were not aware of the law of big numbers. It says that the larger the sample the closer the mean of the sample comes to the mean of the population. That means, the smaller the sample the higher the chance that the mean of the sample varies from the mean of the population. Therefore you can conclude that the chances, that one day 60% of the newborn children are boys, is higher in hospital B. The participants were not aware of that, because they were not aware of the law of big numbers.

They were then asked where it was more likely for a day with at least 60% boys to be born. Most people believed it would be in the large hospital due to the higher birth rate, but this was inaccurate. Both hospitals were equally likely to have over 60% boys born. This error was due to people not considering sample size but instead focusing on the larger number. Those with mathematic background were able to more accurately answer this question.

The participants were now asked to answer, in which of the two hospitals is the possibility higher that 60% of boys are going to be born. \n The results showed, that most of the people answered this question with ‘the chance is equal’ or ‘the bigger hospital has a bigger chance to be at 60% or more’. \n\n This example shows that most of the people were wrong with their answers. They might not know that a higher sample (50 babies each day) is more closely to the mean than a lower sample (15 babies each day). 60% of boys is over the average of  boys that are born everyday. Therefore the chance is higher in the smaller hospital. \n\n To be more specific, people forget about the law of large numbers.

Antwoord: Introduction: The mean of a bigger sample is usually much closer to the population mean, than the mean of a smaller sample. \n People often do not pay enough attention to the sample size in their daily intuitive judgments. Insensitivity to sample size plays here a role: when people pay too much emphasis on a small sample or when people pay too less attention to a big sample. \n In a study a group of psychology students was randomly divided into two groups. One group had to read mean course evaluations of 10 courses. Here the extra information, that the evaluations are based on up to 132 students was provided. The other group viewed 2-3 students commenting on the courses. After that they should choose for a course what they best liked. \n Results of the study were that the study got mainly influenced by the 2-3 students commenting on the courses and not so much by the bigger amount of evaluation. \n Conclusion: This shows how people can easily get influenced by “vivid” information. They were insensitive to sample size, because they put too much emphasis on the smaller sample (2-3 students), instead of the larger sample (the 132 course evaluations). In choices vivid information has a big influence, as this touches our emotions in many cases.

Antwoord: There has been a study where participants were asked in which hospital they believed 60% or more boys were born in more weeks. \n They had to choose between a large hospital with 45 births per week and a small hospital with 15 births per week. Most participants were insensitive to sample size and answered both hospital had the same chances. But the smaller hospital has a higher chance of more births of one gender per day, because their sample (rate of births) is much lower.

Antwoord: In the study, in which it was investigated whether emotional or / and sexual abuse leads to a conversion disorder, randomly selected participants took part. There were two groups, one without abuse in earlier life, the other one with abuse. Both groups had conversion disorders. It was discriminated between different types of abuse, The results were that abuse did not significantly lead to a conversion disorder. The results are only reliable, if the sample is big enough to represent the entire population of people with conversion disorders.

Antwoord: In a study it was made clear how insensitive people are to the sample size. The study was about two hospitals, one large and one small one. In the large one 45 babies were born on average whereas in the small hospital only 15 babies were born per day on average. Now people with no statistical knowledge or background were asked in which of the two hospitals it is more likely that 60% or more boys were born a day. The people choose both hospitals equally often, which is an error regarding to sample size.

Antwoord: A study was done with new students at a university who had to choose a course. They were presented with the results of a questionnaire that was done by the university in which dozens of thousands students reviewed what was the best course to follow. The new students also talked to 2 or 3 students who told them what they thought was the best course. When the new students were asked to choose a course, the researchers found that the new students valued the review of the 2 or 3 students more than the questionnaire that was filled out by so much more students. This shows that the new students were insensitive to sample size.

Antwoord: The question which was supposed to highlight the insensitivity of sample size asked the participants to estimate in which of two given hospitals a larger birthrate of boys on some days was. Given was a large hospital with 45 babies born a day and the other one was a small hospital with 15 babies born a day. When the participant were supposed to estimate in which hospital was more often a male birth rate of 60%, most answered that the chances for both hospitals were equal. The both other probabilities were chosen equally. \n By choosing their answer most participants did not take the Law of Large numbers into account. The law of large numbers states that the larger a sample is the closer the sample mean to the population mean, in this case M=50. \n Therefore the mean of the small hospital deviates more from the population mean and has more often a birth rate of 60%. \n Because of this the study shows insensitivity to sample size.

Antwoord: In a big hospital about 45 babies are born per day, in a smaller hospital it is 15 babies each day. When you ask people in which hospital the probability that 60% or more of the babies that are born on a day are boys is greater, they often answer that the chance is the same for both hospitals. They ignore the Law of Large Numbers. A big sample’s mean is closer to the population mean than the mean of a small sample is. The probability that a baby is a boy is about 50% in the population. For the small hospital, the standard deviation is bigger, the sample mean deviates more from the population mean, so it is more likely that 60% or more of the babies born on a day are boys in a small hospital.

Antwoord: Kahneman and Tversky set up a study to elaborate insensitivity to sample size. Therefore they asked participants (random from population) to estimate in which hospital the birth rate of boys is over 60% per day. \n Participants had to choose between a small hospital, in which 15 births per day were reported and a large hospital with 45. Most of the participants tend to choose the probability to be equal although the probability is larger in the small hospital. \n The chance is usually 50/50 to either get a girl or a boy. But participants are insensitive to sample size and underestimate the law of large numbers. In a smaller sample (and therefore smaller hospital) the probability is much higher to get a probability of over 60% per day (boy’s birth rate) in small hospital because a smaller sample will probably have more outliers, whereas in a large hospital the mean will come closer to 50.

Antwoord: Kahneman and Tversky investigated a study in which participants’ insensitivity to sample size was highlighted. In their study they told participants about two hospitals. In the first, larger hospital the number of births per night was average over 60, whereas in the second, smaller hospital the amount of births per night was on average 15. \n The participants were asked to give an estimation, in which hospital it would be more probable to have 60% boys born in one night. \n Most of the participants, around 80% estimated the chance to be equal for both hospitals, the rest gave an equal estimation for either the large of the small hospital. \n The correct answer would have been the smaller hospital, because the population mean of boys being born is around 50% and considering the Law of Large numbers, larger sample sizes lead to a closer sample mean to the population mean. This study therefore showed insensitivity to sample size.

The question was in which hospital was the probability higher that 60% of the babies that were born were higher. \n The study states that most participants would conclude that the probability is equally large in both hospitals. \n The researchers highlight the insensitivity to sample size with their study. \n As the sample mean of the large hospital is closer to the population mean, the probability is less that 60% of the babies are boys. In the small hospital the sample mean deviates more from the population mean, therefore the probability that 60% of the newborns are boys is larger.

The results revealed that the subjects decisions were balanced (approximately 50% said in the small and 50% said in the big hospital.) \n The 50% who decided for the bigger hospital are insensitive to ‘sample size’, because in the smaller hospitals less babies are born daily, so therefore the possible percentage is not, are not that large, so won’t change that quickly. \n\n It is more likely that the smaller hospital has a birthrate of 60% boys in one week. The subjects did not thought about that and got leaded about the size of the hospital, assuming “the bigger the more likely”. Of course this is wrong and does not happen to people, who studies statistics.

Antwoord: Insensitivity to sample size \n\n In this study insensitivity to sample size is assessed. The participants are students who are about to take a course in the university. Before they attend it the first time, they see 2 short (2 seconds) non-verbal videoclip of the lecturer. Afterwards they take the course for one semester. It is measured, how quick they like the lecturer after the video and after the whole course is done. There is a correlation of .72 with how likeable a lecturer is after the video & after the entire course. This shows that the students stick to their first impression after the video, although 2 seconds are only 2 very small part of how the lecturer is like. Therefore it is an example of insensitivity to sample size.

Antwoord: Two groups of students had to choose a course that they want to follow. One group had to decide based on an evaluation made by 26-132 other students (on a five-point_abbreviation scale). The other group had to choose after seeing 3 students commenting on the course. Research showed that the students who heard the comments were more likely to choose the course although the five-point_abbreviation scale evaluation was based on a much larger sample size, thus, was way more reliable.

Antwoord: In this study there were two hospitals. One hospital where 45 babies per day are born and the other one with 15 babies per day. Students were asked to state in which hospital there are 60% or more boys born per day. Most of them stated that in the hospital with 45 babies per day, the chance is bigger that more boys are born but that is not true. This is an example of sample size insensitivity because the students thought that a larger birth rate also means a larger percentage of boys.

Antwoord: Research study conversion disorder \n\n Study A about a conversion disorder had 26 participants, in which 4 participants with conversion disorder have been sexually abused. \n The results were 4/26=15%. \n\n Study B conducted the same study, but only with 5 participants,3 participants with a conversion disorder have also been sexually abused. \n\n People tend to believe the second study instead of the first, although it would be most reliable if you would combine both studies. \n Then the results would have been 7/31=0,2258=22,58%. Which means that the first study with a larger sample would be closer to the result. \n People do not consider that if the sample is larger, the reliability grows.

Antwoord: There was a study investigated where students had to chose a course for the next year. There were 2 different groups. Group A got provided with statistical results (mean) whereas group B got personal information from 3 previous students. They got provided with statistics (mean) of previous students satisfaction of several courses and then there were 3 other previous students who provided them with personal experience of the courses. The study has shown, that more students have chosen their courses according to the verbal experiences of 3 (!) students, instead of the statistics (with a lot more people (bigger sample)). \n Explanation: people pay more attention to vivid / personal information than to statistical results.

Antwoord: In this study, two hospitals were given. In the first, larger one, 60 children are born in one day, in the other one 15 children a day. It was asked, for which hospital the probability is higher, that 60% boys are born on one day, means for which hospital this was likely to occur more often. People think, that this is the same for both hospitals. But the fact is, that this is less likely for the large hospital, because it is closer to the population mean, so more often, about 50% boys and 50% girls are born. The small hospital is further away from the population mean and so it is more likely that 60% boys are born. So, people would just rely on both hospitals equally, even though the larger one way more reliable. The rule of large numbers of sample size is not taken into account.

Antwoord: In one study the researchers asked the participants what they think about the birth rate of boys in two different hospitals. In the first, larger hospital 45 babies were born on average per day. In the smaller one 15 babies were born on average per day. The participants now had to say in which hospital the probability is higher, that from the babies born each day were 60% boys. The participants said that the probability is equal in both hospitals without thinking about the law of large numbers, which says that when a sample is larger the probability would increase or would be at least higher as in the sample with fewer (in this case) babies born per day

Antwoord: Participants were asked to estimate in which of two hospitals the likelihood that more boys are born at one day is bigger. One hospital was small and just around 15 babies per day were born there. The other hospital was way bigger and way more (around 40) babies were born there per day. Half of the participants stated, that the probability that at one day more boys are born is equal in both hospitals. Other 25% indicated, that in the smaller and the other 25% said that in the bigger hospital the likelihood was bigger. Participants who had a statistics course didn’t make a mistake. According to the law of big numbers the smaller hospital is more likely to get an unequal gender distribution at one day.

Antwoord: Participants were drawn randomly and had never assisted to any statistics lecture; also they didn’t know about the Law of Large Numbers. Two hospitals were described; in the smaller one, an average of 15 babies was born per day; in the bigger one, the average was 45. Participants were asked in which hospital the probability would have been higher that on a certain day 60% of the babies born would have been males. On average the answer was that the probability was the same for both hospitals, but thanks to the Law of Large Numbers we know that the sample size plays a main role in statistics. In this case, insensitivity to sample size lead to the wrong answer (for the participants), because it is known that the bigger the sample size is, the more reliable it is, but more importantly, an average of 15 is to low to draw conclusions from it, statistically speaking. \n degree of control:manipulated \n name of the analysis: exploratory data analysis.

Antwoord: The study by Tversky and Kahneman proved subjects insensitivity to sample size by asking students about two hospitals. One hospital was big and on average delivered 45 children per day, the other was small and delivered 15 children per day. The question was which of the hospitals had more chance to deliver 60 boys in a day. Participants answered (50%) that the chance is equal. The rest (50%) chose the big or the small approximately equal times. Students who studied statistics didn’t fall in the trap of the question. The rest didn’t know or pay attention to the law of large numbers, which says that sample mean is closer to population mean if the sample is bigger. So they have equal chance to both or chose the wrong one. \n The correct answer would be the small hospital because of its size. Since it is smaller it is more unlikely that it’s mean will be close to the population mean (assuming that boys and girls were approximately equally born).

Antwoord: The hospital study described in the book, where asked in which hospital more boys are born in the big one where daily 45 babies are born or in the small one where daily 15 babies are born. When you look at the sample size, samples are more representative if it is a large sample than a small sample, because it is more representative for a population. But in this case it is a little bit different. In the large sample it is more easily to get a normal distribution because the sample is higher, so the chance is higher to have a equally chance of the same size of newborn girls and boys, because the mean of the population and the mean of the sample lies closer together. In the small hospital the mean of the population is farer_nonexisting away so the possibility is higher that in the small hospital more boys are born. The percentage in the small hospital lies by 60%.

Antwoord: Two hospitals were described in a study. One small hospital, where around 15 children were born each day, and a large hospital, where around 65 children were born each day. The question was in which hospital 60% of the new born babies are boys. \n\n Most of the participants said that the probability was equal in both hospitals. \n The rest of the the participants said equally the large or the small hospital. \n\n Participants haven’t had any contact to statistic lessons before. \n\n The right answer is that the probability of 60% being boys is larger in the large hospital because they have a bigger sample size or a bigger amount of newborn babies each day

Antwoord: There are 2 hospitals, a small and a large one. In the small one 15 babies are born each day and 45 in the big one. There are 50% boys born on average a day but sometimes it is 60%. Researchers record the percentage of new born male babies for a year. What do you think in which hospital are more new born male babies? \n The most babies think it is in the small hospital, but it is in the large one. The reason for this thought is that people put too much value on a small sample and too less value on a large sample (? insensitivity to sample size).

Practitioner B: -3 clients with conversion disorder ? 2 of them with a history of sexual abuse \\n ? conclusion: was that 67% of population with conversion disorder experienced sexual abuse \n\n People who read both studies tended to believe that practitioner B is correct as his report contained more vivid information but the truth is that practitioner A is closer to the true percentage of people with conversion disorder and a history of sexual abuse. The explanation is that his sample was larger and therefore a better representation of the population.

Antwoord: Students were randomly allocated to two groups. Group 1 looked at the mean course evaluations of 10 different courses. They were also given the fact that those means were based on samples of at least 25 students. Group 2 viewed personal recommendations of only 3 students. Afterwards, participants of both groups were asked to choose a course that they would like to participate in. Results showed that the subjects were influenced to a greater extent by the personal recommendations in their choice than by the mean evaluations. \n This study shows that people often give too much value to small amounts of vivid information and too little value to information that is actually based on a much larger sample. \n It was also made sure that group 1 understood the information given to them correctly (through a questionnaire. But still, they were less influenced than group 2, which was presented with a much smaller sample.

Antwoord: In one large hospital are on average 45 babies born per day. As a comparison a small hospital is given, where on average 15 babies per day are born. \n People were asked by researchers in which of those two hospitals the probability is higher that on one day 60% of the newborns are boys. The majority of the people answered that the probability is equally great. Therefore they were insensitive to sample size. The people, who were asked were insensitive to the Law of Large numbers. Because the mean in the smaller hospital deviates more from the population mean and therefore the chances are higher that on one day 60% of the newborns are boys.

Antwoord: conversion disorder: \n The study is about the relationship between a conversion disorder and sexual abuse. Group A was a sample of 26 and filled out a questionnaire. The result was that 4 out of 26 participant that have a conversion disorder were sexual abused before, so 15%. \n Group B was observed from a psychologist. He had 3 clients with conversion disorder and 2 out 3 were sexual abused before, so 66%. \n\n If one compare these two results one would assume that in group B a higher chance of conversion disorder is presented. \n\n Here the sample size is important. N=26 is more reliable than N=3. So the results from group A are more reliable, cause the sample size is larger.

One hospital had 45 newborn babies daily and the other one 15 newborn babies daily. The researchers then asked the subjects about the probability of both hospitals to have more days where 60% boys were born. Which hospital would have more days? The subjects answered the chances were equally high, though that is not correct. The bigger hospital with more newborn babies is closer to the population mean and therefore closer to 50% probability, whereas the smaller hospital is not so close to 50%.

Antwoord: Kahneman and Tversky (1972) conducted a study where subjects got the information, that there are two hospitals with a labour station. One small hospital were 15 boys were born, one large hospital with 45 boys born. They were asked, in which hospital the probability is highest that on one day 60% of the children born are boys. Most subjects said that the probability is equally large for both subjects. The rest of the subjects said either the large or the small hospital in the same amount. But in fact most subjects were insensitive to the sample size, as the Law of Large Numbers says that the mean of a sample approaches the population mean if the sample is made large enough. So in the large hospital the probability is greater that it approaches the population mean.

This information was presented to the students in form of statistical data, representing the evaluation of the respective courses. This evaluation was based on the opinions of about 100 students. \n In the other condition the students watched a presentation of three students who recommended their favorite course to them. \n Afterwards the subjects (psychology students) were asked to select their course for the upcoming year. Results showed that the students were much more influenced by the vivid recommendations, than by the statistical data, when electing their courses. That shows that they were insensitive to the size of the sample and that they paid more attention to the vivid information. The statistical data was based on much more data (--> therefore bigger sample) and therefore more representative of the evaluation of the courses by all students.

The participants were told that there is a large hospital in which 45 babies per day are born and a small hospital in which 15 babies per day are born. \n They were than asked in which hospital it is more likely that there are more days on which 60% or more babies are males. \n Most of the participants said that the probability is about equal to both hospitals. \n\n However, they ignored the Law of Large Numbers in their estimation. The sample is much bigger in the larger hospital than in the smaller one. By that, the outcome of the larger sample is much closer to the mean of the population. Thus, it is more likely that the large hospital has more days on which 60% or more boys are born, because the data is more reliable.

When asked which hospital is more likely to have 60% boys born on one day many people made the mistake and said it would be equally possible for both hospitals. In fact the population mean for boys is 50% and the big hospital represents a larger sample and is therefore closer to the population mean as the small hospital. That is why the right answer would be the small hospital that is a smaller sample size and therefore its mean differs more likely from the population mean.

Most participants answered equal. \n\n This reflects insensitivity to sample size, because participants do not take into account the law of large numbers, which states that the larger N (in this case amount of births), the closer the sample mean gets to the population mean (in this case 50%).

Antwoord: A study describing insensitivity to sample size is, for example, a study that was conducted in two hospitals, one of which was significantly larger than the other. Because the one hospital was quite large, and also larger than the other one, the birth rate was comparatively higher. The researchers wanted to find out in which hospital (the smaller one with the lower birth rate or the larger one with the higher birthrate) the participants thought the birth rate of males to be larger than 60% more often. Results showed that the participants guessed the birth rate of males to be larger than 60% more often to be in the smaller hospital with the lower birthrate. This is because the smaller sample (smaller hospital) was underestimated, the participants gave an answer that was guessed wrong. They were insensitive to sample size.

The second group (B) received a course evaluation of two-three students. \n After they read the evaluations they were asked to decide on one course. \n The results showed that the students who saw the evaluation of two-three students (group B) were more influenced by what they red, compared to the other group. \n The findings were interesting because they showed that the students (participants) were insensitive to sample size, meaning that they completely ignored the Law of Large numbers and they were more influenced by a more vivid and personal description of the courses.

Antwoord: Kahneman and Tverskys study about insensitivity to sample size contains two hospitals, a big and a small one. People are asked in which one the birth rate of boys is more likely over 60% is. The majority of people answered that it would be equal possible for both hospitals. \n\n This contains the mistake that the bigger hospital closer to the population is, so more likely to have a 50/50 boy, girl mix. The smaller one has a small sample which means, it can deviate from the population mean

Antwoord: The people in the study were told about two hospitals a small and a large one. In the large hospital 45 babies were born on average per day and in the small hospital 15 children were born on average per day. The participants had to estimate which hospital has the most days on where 60% or more of the babies were borne. The participants thought that it could be equal possible in both hospitals.

Antwoord: In these two hospitals, a big one with 45 births a day and a smaller one with only 15 babies a day. When people were asked where it is more probably that 60% boys will be born a day, they usually say for both hospitals the probability is the same. \n They ignore the Law of large Numbers. Which says that the higher the sample the close it is to the population mean. And we expect to have a probability of 50% birth of boys and 50% for girls in the population. Thus, the larger sample is expected to is closer to the 50% and the probability for 60% boys born a day is larger in the small hospital.

Antwoord: A study considered the birth rate at two different hospitals. In the large hospital, 45 babies are born whereas 16 babies are born in the small hospital in a week. The question asked is where the probability that 60% of the born babies are male is bigger. Most people answer the question by saying that the probability is equal. They do not take the law of large numbers into account and seem to forget that the probability in the small hospital is in fact higher, since the mean of newborns doesn’t reach the population mean as quickly as a large hospital does.

Antwoord: In a study they compare two hospitals. One small and one big. In the big one were more births per day, then in the small one. The researcher ask people in which hospital more often 60% of boys were born. The most people think, it is the same. But it is more often in the small one, because the sample is smaller. If you have a bigger sample the mean is closer to the population mean. So in a big hospital it is more often that (~) 50/50 the birthrate of boys and girls is. Not 60% of boys and 40% of girls.

Antwoord: One example is about an experiment where there are 2 groups. group A receives feedback on a statistics course through paper, Group B receives feedback through peers (3 people), while the group A receives feedback from other 100 students. The observer chooses whether or not to do the statistics course, based either on paper review evaluation or peer evaluation. The results indicated that peer evaluation proved to be more sufficient, even though sample size was different. \n\n Another example is where there is a small hospital and big hospital. The goal was to see how many baby boys were born average over 60%. Insensitivity to sample size would make people assume the larger hospital gave birth more to baby boys. But results indicated that each hospital gave birth (over 60%) to baby boys at the same average. (no difference)

They could choose with the help of results and opinions from previous year students. This could either be from a document with dozens of results and opinions of the previous year, or based on an interview with only 3 students of the previous year. \n The results showed that even though the document had much more opinions, the students nevertheless took the interviews with only 3 students more in account.

Antwoord: An insensitivity to sample size occurs when you are putting on too much weight on a study with a sample that is too small or when you do not consider the results from a study with a large enough sample. \n One example from the book where this happened is when researchers went out to observe the amount of women in a shopping mall. However, they only did this one time and in one shopping mall, so the sample is not big enough to be valid and it shows insensitivity to sample size.

Antwoord: Study on insensitivity to sample size; insufficiently informed \n\n A group of people with no statistical prior knowledge was shown data of the recent birth rate regarding to sexes in rural hospitals. It showed that 60% of the newborn were male. The majority of the tested group thought that these percentage values were also applicable to urban hospitals. However, the difference in sample size was hereby ignored, and the results from the rural area hospitals appeared equally important to the urban hospitals, although the samples from the latter are much higher. Also their results are likely closer to the actual populations value because of the bigger sample. By disregarding the sample size, incorrect results can easily be drawn and afterwards unknowingly generalized. This study showed that, when presented with a seemingly correct study, people tend to put less attention to the actual legitimacy of a study indicated by sample sizes.

Antwoord: A study that highlights insensitivity to sample size is one where participants are told about a large and a much smaller hospital. They are asked to estimate the number of days for each hospital, on which 60% or more of the children born there are boys. Most people estimate the same numbers of days (=Probability) that this is the case for both hospitals. This shows that they are insensitive to sample size, as in the large hospital this is much more unlikely. This is due to the Law of Large numbers, meaning a large sample is closer to the population and in the whole population, the probability will be below 50%.

One large hospital in which 45 babies were born a day and a small hospital in which 15 babies were born a day were described to the participants. The question was: in which hospital is it more likely that 60% or more boys are born at one day? Most participants said that the chance is equal in both hospitals and the remaining participants chose the large and the small hospital equally often. \n This wouldn’t have been the case if they knew something about statistics.

The large hospital had an average 45 births a day, compared to 15 in the small one. People were asked about which hospital they would expect to be more likely to have at least 60% of boys among the newborns. Both hospitals were said to have equal chances, and otherwise they were equally chosen. This incorrect, however, because the small hospital is more likely to obtain that percentage of boys, since less babies are born there and each boy would represent a higher percentage among the population of newborns, compared to the large hospital. Hence, people giving the answer that both hospitals have equal chances are mistaken.

Antwoord: In a study psychology students have been allocated to two groups. One had an evaluation of a course on a scale from 1-10 by 26-132 students. The other group listened to reports by two to three students. The students that listened to personal reports gave more weight to what they heard about the course than to the evaluations which formed a much larger sample with a larger mean. Those students were insensitive to the Law of Large numbers.

Antwoord: Sample bias study. \n\n The study in question 4b is a good example. The result of this study shows that people will assume that the questioner has more knowledge because he appears to know the answers all the time compared to the contestant. The size of the subjects will not change the bias of the sample.

Antwoord: In 1972, Kahneman & Tversky conducted a study to highlight insensitivity to sample size. The participants were given the example of a big hospital, where on average 45 babies are born per day and a small hospital, where 15 babies per day are born. The participants then were asked in which hospital on more days 60% or more boys are born. \n Most participants answered that the amount of days where 60% or more boys are born is equal in both hospitals. The other participants answered equally often, that it would be the big hospital or the small hospital. That shows that the participants are not aware of the Law of Large Numbers

Antwoord: A group  of students had to watch short videos of a lecture and after that they had to rank the quality of him. After the first semester the students ranked the professor in the same way, even if they had been the whole lectures and many of them. The theory of large numbers is not taken into account

Antwoord: In the study students were shown either a statistic about the satisfaction with a particular course (N>40) or presented with talks of 3 individuals about the course (N=3). Although the sample size of the statistic was way higher, the individual talks had more impact on the view about the course, compared to the statistic.

Antwoord: In one study participants were presented two different hospitals. One small hospital and one larger hospital. They then were asked which hospital would have a greater probability of a 60% male birth rate. Most participants, who were not aware of the Law of Large Numbers or not aware of statistics, answered that both hospitals would have the same chance of a 60% male birth rate. In fact this is not true as the larger hospital would be more likely to have such a birth rate for boys. The percentage in small hospitals changes more and stronger just by the birth of one child as the overall number of births in this place would be smaller.

Antwoord: The law of large numbers was ignored in the following case: \n\n The participants were told about two hospitals. A large one with 45 births per day on average and a small one with 15 births per day on average. The participants should estimate in which hospital, there are more than 60% boys born on most days. \n The result was, that the participants estimated the probability to be the same. They thus ignored the law of large numbers and were insensitive to the sample size.

Antwoord: Conducted by Kahneman & Tversky \n\n There was a study conducted where the participants had not taken any statistics courses in the past. They were presented with the next story: There are two hospitals: the small one where 15 children per day are born and the large one where 45 children per day are born. Which hospital has more days where 60% or more of the children born were boys. Most of the subjects answered that the chances were equal and others chose equally between the two hospitals. The answer is of course the small and this had to do with the Law of Large Numbers. The Law states that the larger a sample becomes, that’s how much closer the samples mean will get to the mean of the population. Looking at the whole population the estimated chance of a boy being born is 50%. The Large hospital is a larger sample, thus the mean will be closer to that 50% probably. The small hospital has a smaller sample, so it will deviate more from the population mean. Therefore, the small hospital will have more days where 60% of the newborns will be boys. The participants in this study were insensitive to the sample size, otherwise the majority would’ve chosen the small hospital

Antwoord: A study was conducted where psychology students were assigned to two conditions. In the first condition, the students were evaluations of 10 courses presented with a scale 1 to 10. It was a sample of 26 to 123 students. In the second condition 2 to 3 students shared their experience and opinion of their course. Students should in the indicate which course, they prefer. All students were influenced by the small sample. It was more vivid and so they rely more on the personal experience of two / three students although the other sample more reliable was due to the bigger sample.

Antwoord: Psychology students were divided into two groups. Group A looked at course evaluations from 10 courses. The course evaluations were statistical and they were made from 26-138 students. Group B listened to course evaluations from 2-3 students, who vividly told them about their own experiences with the courses. \n Results: students in group B were much more influenced by the evaluations than those in Group A. Group A had a much larger sample and is therefore closer to the real population ? The students should have been influenced by this. However, the students were more influenced by the vivid information from the small sample. ? insensitivity to sample size ? too little attention to big samples ? too much attention to small samples

Antwoord: Hospital study: The hospital with 120 patients getting to assess their patients, which suffer from depression and have a background of physical abuse. Turns out that only 30% of the patients had such a background.\n\n While a psychologist has 3 patients, which suffer from depression. From this 3, 2 have a past of getting physical abused. So here the percentage is already like 66%. \n\n Although the sample mentioned last is much smaller, the people will rely on it more. Often people (unconscious or conscious) rely more on smaller sample, because they are easier to understand. Simultaneously forgetting that it is too small for making a statement of their results. And as you see it leads to completely incorrect facts, which are not representative for the actual population.

Antwoord: The study designed by Borgida and Nisbett (1977) showed a study concerning vivid information. They had two groups of students, one group received a statistical information about a course elaboration up to 142 elaborations. The other group received information about a course through a few people telling them their experiences in that course. The result was that the students weighed the information given by a few people more than the information of the statistical data although the sample was bigger and more sufficient but it seemed to be forgotten or not taken into account by the students.

Antwoord: Vivid information: 2 different groups received feedback regarding different courses and based on that feedback each participant had to choose if and which course he or she wanted to take. One group received personal feedback from a real person about the courses. The other group was presented with means and data about many different evaluations of the courses. That means that the second group received many more opinions about all the courses. But despite all that the first group was more convinced and took more courses quicker. That means, the vivid, personal, but in terms of number of opinions, limited information, was much more effective than the impersonal statistics, even though the statistics included many more opinions and were objectively more representative.

Antwoord: Study: The study by Nisbett (1979) described an example of insensitivity to sample size. The research assigned psychology students at random into two groups. Under one condition they read an statistical report about evaluated means on a five-number scale from ten courses. The participants also got the information that 32 to 132 students took place in this evaluation. Under the second condition, they viewed 2 to 3 older students commenting on these ten courses. Afterwards the subjects need to chose for one course. Results showed that the students were more influenced by the 2 to 3 reports. Even if this sample was much smaller than the mean evaluations sample.

Antwoord: This study compared two hospitals. A large hospital, in which 45 babies were born everyday, and a small hospital, in which 15 babies were born every day. \n The participants had to tell in which hospital it was more likely that 60% of babies born in one day were boys. Participants estimated the chance of that happening equally big for both hospitals. However, participants who had followed a statistics course answered right: the small hospital. They took into consideration that a small sample deviated more than a large sample

Antwoord: The book discussed a study, where people got asked about the birth rate of boys in two different hospitals. They should estimate where it is more likely that on one day 60% boys got born. One hospital is big and has a high birth rate and the other one is small with a lower birth rate. Most people guessed that the probability is equal that on one day, 60% boys are born. \n This comes due to the fact that these people are insensitive to the sample size, because they do not take into account that the bigger hospital has a higher sample size. A higher sample size is closer to the population. In the whole population boys and girls are usually equally often born, therefore is the probability that on one day boys get born 50%. In a small sample this value decreases, therefore is it more likely that 60% boys get born in the big hospital

Antwoord: 1972  a study was conducted where subjects were ask in which of two hospitals the birth rate of boys (daily) was more likely to be 60%. \n One hospital was large with about 45 birth a day wherefore the other hospital was much smaller with approximately 45 birth a day. \n The asked subjects answered that the likelihood of a birth rate of 60% boys will be same. \n Therefore they underestimated that a larger sample increases the likelihood. They were unaware that the sample size matters

Antwoord: In a study the researchers wanted to do research about insensitivity to sample size. They wanted the participants, who never studied statistics, to estimate in which of two hospitals the probability was higher that 60% of the born babies were boys. The first hospital was small and only 15 babies were born per day on average. The other hospital was bigger and 45 babies were born per day on average. Although the participants knew about that difference in size of the hospital, they estimated that both hospitals have the same probability. The participants were insensitive to sample size.

Antwoord: In a certain study, psychology students were nuvented_nonexisting into two groups. In one condition, they read the mean evaluations of 10 courses on a five point scale. \n The students were informed that those evaluations were based on 26 to 132 students. In the other condition, they listened to 2 to 3 students commenting on the courses. Subsequently, both groups had to decide which course they would join. \n It turned out that the students who listened to the students were influenced more by their vivid stories in their selection of the courses than the students who read the course evaluations, even though the latter were based in much more information, and thus a larger sample

Antwoord: One study, regarding insensitivity to sample size, is about a small and a large hospital. The question was in which hospital the probability that 60% boys are born, is higher. People without statistical knowledge would say that the probability would be equal in both hospitals. Hence, they are not aware of the law of large numbers. The larger hospital has a larger sample, therefore the mean of birthrate would be closer to the population mean of birthrate, which is 50% boys. With statistical knowledge, you would say that the large hospital is less likely to have a probability of 60% boys.

Antwoord: A study, in which it becomes evident that people are sometimes insensitive to sample size, covers the case of two hospitals - a large and a small one. In the large one 45 babies are born on average the day, whereas in the small one 15 babies are born on average per day. \n Up on the question, in which day the probability is higher that 60% of the born babies are boys, the participants rated the probability as equally high. However, hereby they neglected the fact that the sample of the large hospital is three times larger than the one of the small one. this means that the probability to have a day on which 60% of the born babies are boys is also larger.

Antwoord: In a study, participants were asked to estimate in which hospital there would be 60% of boys born more frequently in a week. \n\n The two options was a small hospital and a big one. On average, 15 babies were born daily in the small one and 60 babies in the big one. \n\n Participants would generally  say that there would be equal amount of days where 60% of babies born would be boys.\n\n This is incorrect according to the law of large numbers. It would be more frequent in the small one, because it would deviate more from the population mean

Antwoord: Researchers did an experiment where they presented two hospitals to the subjects. One large hospital, in which 45 boys per day are born and a small one, in which 15 boys are born. The researchers asked the subjects in which hospital 66% of the births per day are boys. The subjects said that both hospitals have an equal amount of boy births. Subjects who studied statistics however, did not do the same error like those, who did not study statistics.
